Bayes.ipynb : Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) is a probabilistic classifier based on Baye's Theorem. In this code, GNB is used on the Iris dataset as a classification model that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on the features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.

DecisionTree.ipynb : This code uses Decision Tree classifier to perform classification on the well-known 'Iris' dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers categorised into 3 species based on 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal lenght and petal width. We visalize the decision tree and then set max_depth = 2 using gini index, this is post-prunning. We then use pre-prunning on the same dataset. We use GridSearchCV to scan over the parameters like criteria (gini, entropy), max-depth and find the best-fit parameters. In this notebook, we also implement Decision tree regressor on Diabetes dataset to predict the outcome i.e. the quantitative measure of the disease based on 10 factors like BMI, blood pressure etc.
