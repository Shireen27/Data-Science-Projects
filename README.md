Bayes.ipynb : Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) is a probabilistic classifier based on Baye's Theorem. In this code, GNB is used on the Iris dataset as a classification model that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on the features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.

DecisionTree.ipynb : This code uses Decision Tree classifier to perform classification on the well-known 'Iris' dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers categorised into 3 species based on 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal lenght and petal width. We visalize the decision tree and then set max_depth = 2 using gini index, this is post-prunning. We then use pre-prunning on the same dataset. We use GridSearchCV to scan over the parameters like criteria (gini, entropy), max-depth and find the best-fit parameters. In this notebook, we also implement Decision tree regressor on Diabetes dataset to predict the outcome i.e. the quantitative measure of the disease based on 10 factors like BMI, blood pressure etc. 

Gas_prices_predict.ipynb : This code involves building a time series model that captures the patterns in the past natural gas prices data and incorporates additional features like seasonality using SARIMAX (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average). ARIMA captures the general trend, movement and noise while SARIMAX captures recurring patterns at regular intervals which are seen in natural gas prices due to higher or lower demands in winters and summer.

K-means clustering:The K-means clustering algorithm which is an unsupervised learning method that groups data into K distinct clusters is applied on make_blobs dataset. Randomly pics K number of centroids, assigns each datapoint in X to the nearest centroid using Euclidean distance. Then calculates new centroids as the mean of all points in each cluster.
